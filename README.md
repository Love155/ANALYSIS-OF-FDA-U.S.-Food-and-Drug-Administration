## Problem Statement

## Part - 1  SQL Queries

- Task 1: Identifying Approval Trends.
- Task 2: Segmentation Analysis Based on Drug Marketing Status.
- Task 3: Analyzing Products.
- Task 4: Exploring Therapeutic Classes and Approval Trends.

## Part - 2  Power BI Visualizations

- Task 1: Visualize the yearly approval trends of drugs. Highlight any significant patterns and/or fluctuations, if any.
- Task 2: Explore approval trends over the years based on different sponsors. Uncover patterns and changes in approval rates among sponsors.
- Task 3: Visualize the segmentation of products based on Marketing Status.
- Task 4: Show the total number of applications for each Marketing Status. Enable users to filter by years and Marketing Status for detailed analysis.
- Task 5: Analyze the grouping of drugs by dosage form. Visualize the distribution of approvals across different forms. Identify the most successful dosage form.
- Task 6: Visualize drug approvals based on therapeutic classes. Identify classes with the highest number of approvals.

## FDA U.S. Food and Drug Administration analyst data by using Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining methodology followed below steps:-

- Business Understanding : The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is a federal agency responsible for safeguarding public health in the United States. It oversees various areas, including food safety, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, cosmetics, tobacco, and veterinary products. The FDA evaluates the safety and efficacy of drugs, biological products, and medical devices, conducts inspections, and enforces regulations. It also 
regulates food production and distribution, conducts research, provides public health education, and monitors and responds to emerging health risks. The project aims to use data-driven methods to create informative reports by conducting a thorough analysis of the data using powerful tools like MySQL and Power BI. 

- Data Understanding : After gaining a through understanding of the business requirements, we accessed the data to explore it further, By observing "Data Schema (Draugs@FDA Dataset)" for better understanding a business. These columns description involved in business understanding. 

- Data Preparation : After completing the phases of business understanding and data understanding, we conducted “Data Preparation”. During this phase, we conduct all four tasks of SQL Queries for completing the project goals. 

- Modeling & Evaluation :  In Modeling and Evaluation, during this phase we use Power BI Visualization for filter the data and for better understanding. We are using multiple charts like - line chart, stacked area chart, scatter chart, Donut chart etc. to summarize the data for insights.

- Deployment : By using above Modeling & Evaluation have made an FDA DATA ANALYSIS OF DASHBOARD for a deeper understanding of FDA operations and draw meaningful insights from the data For Real-time monitoring dashboard for tracking all the Project Goals. This will also help to compare different models and identify the best one for the situation.
